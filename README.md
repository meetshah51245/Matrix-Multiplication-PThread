# Matrix-Multiplication-PThread
</br></br>
Multi-threading can be done to improve the complexity of matrix multiplication. In multi-threading, instead of utilizing a single core of your processor, we utilizes all or more core to solve the problem.

We create different threads, each thread evaluating some part of matrix multiplication.
Depending upon the number of cores your processor has, you can create the number of threads required. Although you can create as many threads as you need, a better way is to create each thread for one core.
